1. **Code Generation Only**: Write Python code and perform static analysis. Do NOT run or execute the application unless explicitly asked for debugging purposes.

2. **Use Latest APIs**: 
   - Use current PyQt6 methods (avoid deprecated Qt5 syntax)
   - Use qfluentwidgets components instead of standard PyQt6 widgets
   - Check documentation for the latest stable versions before implementing

3. **Code Review Checklist**: Before submitting code changes, verify:
   - Syntax is correct
   - Imports are present and correct
   - Variable names are consistent
   - Logic flow makes sense
   - No obvious runtime errors

4. **Ask Before Assuming**: If the user's request is unclear or could be interpreted multiple ways, ask specific clarifying questions like:
   - "Do you want X or Y behavior?"
   - "Should this apply to all cases or just specific ones?"
   - "What should happen when [edge case] occurs?"

5. **Debug Systematically**: When code doesn't work as expected:
   - Read the full error message carefully
   - Check the relevant documentation
   - Examine the code structure and data flow
   - Identify the specific line or component causing issues

   - Avoid making random small changes hoping something works
